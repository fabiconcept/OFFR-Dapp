# Getting Started OFFR Token Dapp
This is a Decentralized Application (Dapp) built using *React.js* and *Ethers.js*, as well as other complimentary libraries, that allows users to manage their tokens in a secure and decentralized way. The Token Management Dapp provides users with a user-friendly interface that enables them to create an account, complete a KYC process, buy tokens, and track their dividend earnings from the tokens they hold.

## Features
- **Account Creation**: Users can create an account and securely store their private key in their browser's local storage, ensuring complete control over their tokens.
- **KYC Process**: Before purchasing tokens, users must complete a Know Your Customer (KYC) process, which is necessary for compliance with regulatory requirements.
- **Token Purchase**: Once a user has completed the KYC process, they can purchase tokens if tokens are on sale.
Dividend Tracking: Users can track their dividend earnings from the tokens they hold.
- **Token Management**: If a user's wallet is the owner of the token, they will have access to the Token Management page, where they can perform actions such as token transfer and burning.
- **Dividend Management**: If a user's wallet is the owner of the token, they will also have access to the Dividend Management page, where they can distribute dividends to token holders.
